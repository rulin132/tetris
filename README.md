# Tetris

A simple Tetris game inspired and roughly based on the work of [Michael Kar√©n](https://github.com/melcor76) which is built on [Angular](https://angular.io).

Upcoming Features:
* Sounds for clearing lines and winning levels
* Some nice tunes
* Ability to toggle sound on and off
* Storing the highscore on the server


## Getting started

To start playing the game,

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from [Here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), then run `yarn install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


### Building the project

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
